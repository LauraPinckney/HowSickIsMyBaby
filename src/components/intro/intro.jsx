      <h2>How this works</h2>
      <p>
        How Sick is My Baby? is designed to help you decide whether your baby
        needs a doctor. How Sick is My Baby? contains 19 simple checks which
        test for different symptoms or signs of illness. Each check has a score.
        Go through all the checks, the scores will be added all together at the
        end. The higher the score the sicker the baby is likely to be.
